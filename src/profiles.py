Handles data loading for voter profiles and generation of simulated reactions
using a generative AI model (Google Gemini).

This module is responsible for:
- Loading voter data from a CSV file ('sample_voter_file.csv').
- Validating the presence of essential columns in the voter data.
- Configuring and interacting with the Google Gemini API to generate
  text-based reactions based on voter profiles and input speech.

    Generates a simulated voter reaction to a given speech using the Gemini API.

    Constructs a prompt based on the voter's demographic and political profile

    model initialization, and API call failures.
